For some pages with infinite scrolling, in order to optimize the performance, the scrolled frames will be taken down for recycling, and placed at the back of the page. The old bottle of new wine will reappear in front of you.
At this time, getImage.js may only get the image of the current display area.
This bookmarking script is designed to deal with this situation!
Write down all the pictures that have appeared in a small book, and finally show them all! ! !

Instructions:

A list of pictures will appear at the top of the page,
At this time, you can use getImage.js to get the original images of these pictures;

Although it is very rookie, please sign it for reprinting, thank you! ðŸ˜‚
